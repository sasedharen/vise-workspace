## Common Development Commands

### Backend (vise-backend/)
```bash
# Development
make run                  # Start the backend server
make seed                 # Seed development data
make lint                 # Run Go linting and formatting
make deps                 # Install dependencies and run checks
make build                # Build all binaries

# Testing
make test                 # Run unit tests
make test-coverage        # Run tests with coverage report
make test-integration     # Run integration tests

# Database
make migrate             # Run Flyway migrations
flyway migrate           # Direct Flyway command

# Database Access (Critical for Schema Verification)
PGPASSWORD=vise psql -U postgres -h localhost -d vise    # Direct database access

# Docker
make docker-run          # Start all services with Docker Compose
make docker-build        # Build Docker image

# Testing  
Always use the test-admission-form.json with updated data with curl to test the application workflow. Seeder is gone and forget about updating it.

# Admission Workflow Testing
When testing admission workflow, update these unique fields in test-admission-form.json for each test:
- **aadhaar_id**: 12-digit unique identifier (student.aadhaar_id)
- **apaar_id**: Alphanumeric unique identifier (student.apaar_id) 
- **emis_no**: 10-digit EMIS number (student.emis_no) - optional field
- **email**: Student email address (student.email)
- **primary_mobile**: Student mobile number (student.primary_mobile)
- **roll_no**: Student roll number (student.roll_no)
- **contact_number**: Father's contact (father.contact_number)
- **contact_number**: Mother's contact (mother.contact_number)
- **email**: Father's email (father.email) 
- **email**: Mother's email (mother.email)
- **pan_card**: Father's PAN (father.pan_card)
- **pan_card**: Mother's PAN (mother.pan_card)

## Complete Admission Workflow States
1. **draft** → 2. **submitted** → 3. **pending** → 4. **review** → 5. **accepted** → 6. **offer** → 7. **fees** → 8. **enrolled**

Alternative end states: **rejected**, **withdrawn**, **expired**, **offer_rejected**

### Workflow Progression:
- Draft → Submitted (via API: POST /api/v1/admissions/submit)
- Submitted → Pending (application submitted for document verification)
- Pending → Review (document verification in progress)
- Review → Accepted (admin approval after verification)
- Accepted → Offer (offer letter issued)
- Offer → Fees (student accepts offer) OR Offer → Offer_Rejected (student rejects)
- Fees → Enrolled (after fee payment confirmation)

## Complete Admission Test Flow (Server running on :6000)

### Test Data Files

PGPASSWORD=vise psql -U postgres -h localhost -d vise -c "
SELECT enrollment_id, application_status, created_time, submitted_time, 
       reviewed_time, offer_issued_time, offer_response_time, fees_paid_time, enrolled_time
FROM users.application 
WHERE enrollment_id = 'YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID';"

# Check Related Data
PGPASSWORD=vise psql -U postgres -h localhost -d vise -c "
SELECT 'Student' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users.student WHERE enrollment_id = 'YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Parent' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users.parent WHERE enrollment_id = 'YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Sibling' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users.sibling WHERE enrollment_id = 'YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID'
UNION ALL
SELECT 'Academic' as table_name, COUNT(*) as count FROM users.academic WHERE enrollment_id = 'YOUR_ENROLLMENT_ID';"
```

### Known Issues
- **Document Verification Bug**: Code hardcodes state_code="01", district_code="001", branch_code="001" instead of using application's actual codes
- **Workflow API Responses**: Some endpoints return generic error messages that need specific error details
- **Document Verification Table**: VARCHAR(2) constraints prevent storing 3-digit values

- ✅ **Parent Records**: Fixed check constraint `chk_parent_type` to allow lowercase values
- ✅ **UUID Support**: Extended application_id column from VARCHAR(24) to VARCHAR(36)
- ✅ **Document Verification**: Core verification endpoints working and storing records

### Database Configuration
- ✅ **PostgreSQL Timezone**: Set to `Asia/Kolkata` (IST) for India-only deployment
- ✅ **Timestamp Types**: All tables use `timestamp without time zone` for consistency
- ✅ **Schema Updates**: Document verification system fully restructured with enrollment_id focus
- ✅ **EMIS Number**: Added nullable 10-digit EMIS number field to student table with validation

### Users Schema Table Dependency Order (for TRUNCATE operations)
**Critical:** When cleaning up users schema data, follow this exact order to respect foreign key constraints:
```sql
-- Dependency order for safe TRUNCATE CASCADE operations:
TRUNCATE users.document_verification CASCADE;  -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.document CASCADE;               -- References enrollment_id  
TRUNCATE users.academic CASCADE;               -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.skill CASCADE;                  -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.sport CASCADE;                  -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.sibling CASCADE;                -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.parent CASCADE;                 -- References enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.application CASCADE;            -- Core table with enrollment_id
TRUNCATE users.student CASCADE;                -- Primary table with enrollment_id
```

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **Document Verification Table**: Created with proper structure using enrollment_id
- ✅ **Parent Records**: Fixed check constraint to allow lowercase values
- ✅ **UUID Support**: Extended application_id column from VARCHAR(24) to VARCHAR(36)
- ✅ **Document Verification**: Core verification endpoints working with enrollment_id
- ✅ **Timestamp Consistency**: All _time columns use timestamp without time zone
- ✅ **Branch Structure**: Updated to use state_code/district_code/branch_code with CASCADE FKs
- ✅ **Database Normalization**: Removed redundant geographic fields from related tables
- ✅ **Foreign Key Constraints**: Added proper FK relationships for institution_code fields

## Database Architecture (Updated 2025-08-16)

### Geographic Hierarchy Normalization
The database has been normalized to eliminate redundant data storage. Geographic hierarchy (state_code, district_code, branch_code, institution_code) is now stored only in master tables:

#### Master Tables with Geographic Fields:
- **users.application** - Contains complete geographic hierarchy
- **users.student** - Contains complete geographic hierarchy  
- **codes.geographic** - State and district codes
- **codes.branch** - Branch information 
- **codes.institution** - Institution master data

#### Related Tables (Normalized):
All related tables access geographic information via `enrollment_id` relationships:
- **users.parent** - No geographic fields (access via enrollment_id → application)
- **users.sibling** - No geographic fields (access via enrollment_id → application)
- **users.academic** - No geographic fields (access via enrollment_id → application)
- **users.document** - No geographic fields (access via enrollment_id → application)
- **users.document_verification** - No geographic fields (access via enrollment_id → application)

#### Benefits of Normalization:
1. **Eliminated Data Redundancy** - Geographic hierarchy stored only where needed
2. **Improved Data Consistency** - Single source of truth for geographic information
3. **Simplified Maintenance** - Geographic changes require updates in fewer places
4. **Better Performance** - Reduced storage overhead and faster queries
5. **Referential Integrity** - Proper foreign key constraints ensure data consistency

#### Foreign Key Relationships Added:
```sql
-- Institution code foreign keys
ALTER TABLE users.application 
ADD CONSTRAINT application_institution_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (institution_code) REFERENCES codes.institution(institution_code);

ALTER TABLE users.student 
ADD CONSTRAINT student_institution_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (institution_code) REFERENCES codes.institution(institution_code);
```

#### Example Query Pattern:
To get geographic information for any related record, join through enrollment_id:
```sql
-- Get parent data with geographic information
SELECT p.*, a.state_code, a.district_code, a.branch_code, a.institution_code
FROM users.parent p
JOIN users.application a ON p.enrollment_id = a.enrollment_id
WHERE p.enrollment_id = '3326110025054727';
```
```

### Frontend (vise-frontend/)
```bash
# Development
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run build            # Build for production
npm run lint             # Run ESLint

# Testing
npm run test             # Run Playwright tests
npm run test:ui          # Run Playwright with UI mode
npm run test:admissions  # Run admission-specific tests
```

### Auth Service (auth-service/)
```bash
go run main.go           # Start auth service
```

## Architecture Principles

### Schema Synchronization Rule (Critical)
When creating or modifying data structures, **always maintain consistency** across:
1. **Database schema**: `vise-backend/db/migrations/V{number}__{description}.sql`
2. **GORM model**: `vise-backend/internal/{module}/domain/{entity}.go`  
3. **TypeScript interface**: `vise-frontend/src/types/index.ts`

All three layers must match exactly in fields and types.

**Schema Verification Protocol**: 
- **ALWAYS** verify actual database schema using: `PGPASSWORD=vise psql -U postgres -h localhost -d vise`
- Use `\d table_name` to inspect actual table structure before making changes
- Cross-reference with Flyway migration files in `db/migrations/` 
- Ensure GORM domain models match actual database columns
- Validate that repository layer properly handles all database fields

### Multi-tenancy Design
- Every table includes `branch_id` for branch isolation
- All queries must filter by `branch_id`
- Proper indexing on `branch_id` for performance

### Module Structure
Each business module follows this pattern:
```
internal/{module}/
├── domain/          # GORM models and business entities
├── handler/         # HTTP handlers and API endpoints
├── repository/      # Data access layer
├── service/         # Business logic layer
├── routes/          # API route definitions
└── seeder/          # Development data seeding
```

### API Conventions
- RESTful endpoints: `GET /api/v1/{module}`, `POST /api/v1/{module}`, etc.
- Consistent error handling and response formats
- JWT authentication for all protected endpoints
- Role-based access control validation

## Core Business Modules

1. **Admissions** - Student application and enrollment workflow
2. **Users** - User management across all roles
3. **Administration** - Multi-branch organizational management  
4. **Finance** - Fee collection and financial operations
5. **Academic** - Course management and grading
6. **Sports** - Sports programs and performance tracking
7. **Health** - Student health records and wellness
8. **Transport** - Vehicle and route management
9. **Food** - Nutrition and canteen management
10. **Media** - Digital content and announcements

## Database Guidelines

### Type Mappings
| PostgreSQL | GORM (Go) | TypeScript |
|------------|-----------|------------|
| UUID | uuid.UUID | string |
| VARCHAR | string | string |
| INTEGER | int32 | number |
| BOOLEAN | bool | boolean |
| TIMESTAMP | time.Time | Date \| string |
| JSONB | json.RawMessage | any/object |

### Standard Model Structure
```go
type Entity struct {
    ID        uuid.UUID      `gorm:"type:uuid;default:gen_random_uuid();primaryKey" json:"id"`
    BranchID  string         `json:"branch_id" gorm:"column:branch_id;index"`
    CreatedAt time.Time      `json:"created_at"`
    UpdatedAt time.Time      `json:"updated_at"`
    DeletedAt gorm.DeletedAt `gorm:"index" json:"deleted_at,omitempty"`
    // Entity-specific fields...
}
```

## Testing Strategy

### Test Distribution
- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests (25%)**: Cross-component functionality  
- **E2E Tests (5%)**: Complete user workflows with Playwright

### Key Test Scenarios
- Authentication flows and role-based access
- Student admission workflow end-to-end
- Multi-branch data isolation
- Payment processing integration
- Form validation and error handling

## Development Workflow

### Performance Considerations
- Designed for 10,000+ concurrent users
- Database query optimization with proper indexing
- Redis caching for frequently accessed data
- Connection pooling for database efficiency
- Sub-2s response time targets

### Code Quality Standards
- All modules must include proper error handling
- Comprehensive input validation (frontend and backend)
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Security best practices (SQL injection prevention, XSS protection)
- GDPR and FERPA compliance for student data

## Special Notes

### Temporal Workflows
The system uses Temporal.io for background processing:
- Draft application saving
- Document processing workflows
- Application submission processing

### Authentication Integration
- JWT-based authentication via separate auth-service
- OAuth 2.0 support for external providers
- Multi-factor authentication (2FA) capability
- Hierarchical role system across branches

### Frontend Architecture
- React with TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet/desktop
- Context-based state management
- Toast notifications for user feedback

This system is designed to scale to millions of users while maintaining performance and data integrity across multiple school branches.
